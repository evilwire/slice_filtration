\section{Filtration on Cycle Modules}

Let us recall definition and results of cycle modules, first
defined in \cite{Ro96}. In the following, let $S$ be a separated 
scheme of finite type over any base field $k$. Let $\fields(B)$ 
be the class of fields $F$ finitely generated over $k$ such that
$\spec F$ is a $B$-scheme.

\begin{definition}
A \emph{cycle premodule} on $\fields{B}$ is an object function
that associated to each $F \in \fields{B}$ a $\Z$-graded abelian
group $M(F) = \prod_i M_i(K)$ with the following data:

\begin{enumerate}
\item[\textbf{D1.}] For each $\phi: F \to E$, there is a degree 0
map $\phi_*: M(F) \to M(E)$ called the \emph{restriction map 
associated to $\phi$}

\item[\textbf{D2.}] For each finite $\phi: F \to E$, there is a 
degree 0 map $\phi^*: M(E) \to M(F)$ called the \emph{corestriction
map associated to $\phi$}

\item[\textbf{D3.}] For each $F$, the group $M(F)$ is equipped
with a left $K^M_*(F)$-module, where $K^M_*(F)$ is the Milnor
$K$-ring of $F$.

\item[\textbf{D4.}] For any valuation $v$ of $F$, there exists 
maps $\res{v}: M(F) \to M(\kappa(v))$ and $\special{v}{\idprime{p}}$
called the \emph{residue} and \emph{specialization} respectively, 
where $\kappa(v)$ is the residue field of $v$ and $\idprime{p}$ is 
a prime of $v$,
\end{enumerate}

subject to the following conditions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item[\textbf{R1a.}] For each $\phi: F \to E$ and $\psi: E \to L$,
$(\psi \comp \phi)_* = \psi_* \comp \phi_*$

\item[\textbf{R1b.}] For each finite $\phi: F \to E$ and $\psi: E
\to L$, $(\psi \comp \phi)^* = \phi^* \comp \psi^*$

\item[\textbf{R1c.}] For $\phi: F \to E$ and $\psi: E \to L$ with
$\phi$ finite, define $R = E \otimes_F L$, and let $\idprime{p}$
be any prime ideal of $R$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
