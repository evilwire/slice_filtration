slice_filtration
================

A full summary of the work of Voevodsky, Deglise, Rost, and Huber-Kahn-Sujartha, 
together with my own contributrions. The ultimate goal is to establish a filtration
on the category of DMeff and DM. This is achieved by first establishing a filtration
structure on HI, then extending this to HI_*. Along the way, we obtain a slice
filtration on the category of Cycle Modules for free.
