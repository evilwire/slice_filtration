\section{The Category of Homotopy Invariance}

In this section, we elaborate on the structure of the abelian
category of homotopy invariant sheaves with transfers ($\HI$) and 
show that $\HI$ has the following properties:

\begin{enumerate}

\item $\HI$ is a Grothendieck category that is well-powered.

\item $\HI$ is a closed monoidal category. That is, $\HI$ 
emits a symmetric tensor $\htensor$ and an internal hom
functor $\hhom$ such that
\[
\hom_{\HI}(F \htensor G, F') = \hom_{\HI}(F, \hhom(G, F'))
\]
\end{enumerate}
