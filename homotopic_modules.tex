\section{The Category of $\HI$}

In this section, we elaborate on the structure of the abelian
category of homotopy invariant sheaves with transfers ($\HI$) and 
show that $\HI$ has the following properties:

\begin{enumerate}

\item $\HI$ is a Grothendieck category that is well-powered.

\item $\HI$ is a closed monoidal category. That is, $\HI$ 
emits a symmetric tensor $\htensor$ and an internal hom
functor $\hhom$ such that
\[
\hom_{\HI}(F \htensor G, F') = \hom_{\HI}(F, \hhom(G, F'))
\]

We first define the tensor structure on $\HI$. By ---, there
is a $t$-structure on $\DMeff$, whose heart is $\HI$. Therefore, 
we may regard $\HI$ as a subcategory of $\DMeff$, whose 
reflection is the cohomology functor $\H^0$ associated to the
$t$-structure.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Homotopy Modules}

\newcommand{\cmcohom}{A}

Consider a cycle module $M$. According to [Deg2.5], $\cmcohom{0}(-,M)$
defines a graded presheaf with transfers. According to [Deg06, 6.9],
presheaf is in fact a sheaf. We write $F^M$ for the corresponding
sheaf, and define a homotopic module strucutre as follows.

Let $X$ be a smooth scheme. Begin by considering the long exact
localization sequence (Deg.2.5c) associated to the zero section of
$X \to X \times \A^1$
