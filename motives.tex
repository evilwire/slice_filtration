\section{Derived Category of Motives}

In this section, we define the triangulated category of motives.
The approach we adopt here closely mirrors that of [MVW]. The main
results in this section is that the derived category of motives
emits a $t$-structure, the heart of which is the category of Nisnevich 
homotopy invariant sheaves with transfers.
