\section{Slice filtration on the category of motives}

We now introduce the slice filtration on $\DMeff$. The results here
are based on the work of [HuKaSu]. Let us first fix a more 
convenient set of notations. For each $M \in \DMeff$, set $M(n) = 
l \tensorDM \Z(n)$, and $M_{-n} = \RHomDM(\Z(n), M)$. Since $M \mapsto
M(n)$ is left adjoint to $M \mapsto M_{-n}$, we have a 
distinguished triangle 
\begin{equation}\label{slice_triangle_1}
M_{-n}(n) \to M \to M' \to M_{-n}(n)[1],
\end{equation}
for each $n \geq 0$, and some $M'$. 

\begin{prop}
Fixing $n \geq 0$, the $M'$ in the distinguished triangle in
(\ref{slice_triangle_1}) is defined up to unique isomorphism.

In this case, associating $M$ with $M'$ is functorial.
\end{prop}

We write $\slDM{n}$ for this functor, and $\sgDM{n}$ for the
functor $M \mapsto M_{-n}(n)$.

\begin{prop}
For each $n \geq$, the functors $\slDM{n}$ and $\sgDM{n}$ are
both triangulated. That is, if
\[
M' \to M \to M'' \to M'[1]
\]
is a distinguished triangle, so are
\[
\sgDM{n}M' \to \sgDM{n}M \to \sgDM{n}M'' \to \sgDM{n}M'[1]
\]
and
\[
\slDM{n}M' \to \slDM{n}M \to \slDM{n}M'' \to \slDM{n}M'[1].
\]
\end{prop}

Let $\DMeff(n)$ be the full subcategory of objects of the type 
$M(n)$ where $M \in \DMeff$, and let $\DMeff_{n}$ be the full 
subcategory of $M \in \DMeff$ such that $M_{-n} = 0$.

\begin{prop}
$\slDM{n}$ is right adjoint to the inclusion of $\DMeff(n)$ into 
$\DMeff$. 
\end{prop}

Let $\DMeff_{-n}$ be the full subcategory of objects for which
$\slDM{n}(M) = 0$.

\begin{prop}
$\slDM{n}$ is left adjoint to the inclusion of $\DMeff_{-n}$ into 
$\DMeff$. 
\end{prop}

Furthermore, we have two towers --- one ascending, one descending 
--- of subcategories.
