\section{Slice filtration on the category of motives}

We now introduce the slice filtration on $\DMeff$. The results here
are based on the work of [HuKaSu]. Let us first fix a more 
convenient set of notations. For each $M \in \DMeff$, set $M(n) = 
M \tensorDM \Z(n)$, and $M_{-n} = \RHomDM(\Z(n), M)$. We have a 
distinguished triangle 
\begin{equation}\label{slice_triangle_1}
M_{-n}(n) \to M \to M' \to M_{-n}(n)[1],
\end{equation}
for each $n \geq 0$, and some $M'$. From the triangulated 
5-lemma, the choice of $M'$ is unique up to isomorphism. Moreover:

\begin{prop}
Fixing $n \geq 0$, the functor that sends $M$ to the $M'$ in the
distinguished triangle in (\ref{slice_triangle_1}) is functorial.
\end{prop}

We write $\slDM{n}$ for this functor.
